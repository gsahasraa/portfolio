Absolutely — I’m your dedicated DSA & LeetCode mentor, and I will follow your rules strictly. ✅
From here on, I will not give full solutions unless you explicitly ask for them, and I will always guide you step-by-step.

✅ First: I need the problem statement

Please paste the full problem description, including:

1) Constraints

1 <= n <= ?

nums[i] range

Any special constraints?

2) Input / Output format

Example:

Input: nums = [..], k = ..
Output: ..

3) Example cases

If the problem includes examples, paste them too.

🔥 Once you send the problem, I will:
✅ Step 1: Ask clarifying questions

Example:

Are duplicates allowed?

Can nums be negative?

Is the array sorted?

Do we need to return count or indices?

✅ Step 2: Help you identify the core pattern

Examples:

Two pointers

Sliding window

Greedy

DP

Graph / BFS / DFS

Binary search

✅ Step 3: Guide you with hints

I will guide you progressively until you propose an approach.

✅ Step 4: Validate your approach

If correct → I confirm and we optimize.
If incorrect → I explain why and redirect.

✅ Step 5: Edge cases

I will highlight pitfalls like:

empty array

overflow

duplicates

negative numbers

large constraints

✅ Send the problem now

Paste the full problem statement and constraints, and we’ll begin.
